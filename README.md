# IRIS Petal Data Analysis Project

## Intro
This project is for the class of OPS802. The target of the project is to have a hands on full data analytics experience from A to Z. That means starting with raw data and reading it into python then doing some analytical and statstical observations on the data and finally doing some supervised and unsupervised learning on the data. The data we will use for this project is one of the most famous datasets in the machine learning world which is called IRIS classification dataset. That means there is plenty of resources for you online to learn from and that you are not the first person who saw and analyzed this data. Use this to your advantage. The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" as an example of linear discriminant analysis. We will describe it more in details later. The project measures the capabilities of lodaing data, cleaning it up, running some tests and statistical analysis and finally machine learning. The following highlights the project

..* The project consists of four parts, they are mostly independent and in order based on what we studies in class
..* The deadline of the project is the last day of the quarter
..* The project is individual, however I encourage you to talk to each other to check your different approaches without copying codes or talking about detailed code specific. For example, it is ok to ask about which function you have used to tackle part a and is it better than this other function or not. It is not ok to copy the exact code including that function you asked about.
..* You are expected to heavily utilize resources outside the class notebooks such as Google, StackOverflow, .. etc
..* Code cleanings and Display has 10% of the grade
